# The Singularity of Fiction
## INTRODUCTION

The hurricane of the idea of taking property from an owner to achieve an artistic end is raging with the blissful Artificial Intelligence to the point of being labeled as a form of theft. The AI needs a dataset to be trained to obtain ways to replicate such information based on user input.

This is why a way is proposed to charge royalties by entering properties into the AIs dataset and thus obtain an accumulation of wealth on the part of the owners.

But what would happen when you never get such property from the owner and manage to get the same results? Welcome to what I call The Singularity of Fiction. And this has its greatest utility in art.

## PRINCIPLES

Recall that:
1. A property possesses owner.
2. It is necessary to be owner to have control over such property, being: What is done, How it is done, Where it is done, When it is done, With whom it is done, With what it is done. This control is exercised thanks to the Copyrights where the owner has the monopoly of violence over who uses his property (he can sanction whoever he wants if his property is used without a previous agreement).

## DEFINITION

What is this? Based on the above, it means that we can introduce datasets where no property of anyone at all is required. How? Being able to synthesize purely with mathematical abstraction the matter that will then be used as datasets for AI. And the results would be similar or even equal compared to using properties of people as datasets.

What this means is to create extremely realistic or accurate information/data to reality thanks to mathematics itself. In other words, there is absolutely no transfer of ownership of anything because this same property can be completely replicated without the owner.

In other words, the owner would be completely unable both philosophically and legally to claim authorship and then demand royalties or control over the AI dataset for the mere fact that this information was no transfer of absolutely no person as it is pure mathematical abstraction.

An example that could be applied to reality is voice cloning. We all know that to clone a voice, you need to collect recordings of an owner (person), and that recording is the property, both the recording and the whole anatomical set of the owner to give product to such a voice.

Typically, an artist needs voices to produce fiction whether in music, radio or film. This leads him to consult owners (voice actors/singers) who charge for services (generating voice, their property) and who are then recorded to be introduced to that medium. These owners require this dependence on the artist not only to subsist, but also to accumulate wealth. So the artist pays and manages to materialize his artistic ideas. This is the cycle that is still done today.

The “giant loophole” of this is the fact that a voice cannot be protected as property since this voice is not unique and therefore can be considered generic. This reduces the owner to only being able to sue if an attempt is made to usurp his identity or the recordings where he has the voice are his property.

The modus operandi of voice cloning is to collect these recordings. But what if we use something called Physical Modeling Synthesis.

We could create a synthesizer that is able to realistically replicate every human voice thanks to mathematical acoustic models that replicate the way we produce the voice (airflow from the lungs, vocal cords, skull shape, among others).

Recordings of this synthesizer are generated and then fed into the AI as a dataset, resulting in a voice clone just as if we were using the voice of a human (owner).

The result is that, since there is no such transfer of ownership in the first place and this particular property cannot be considered unique, there can be no control over the dataset and therefore the AI ends up being completely free of any control, making artists no longer have that dependence on owners and use the AI at no cost, correctly materializing their creative ideas, bringing about the singularity in fiction.

And no person can do absolutely nothing, why?

Trying to control this has some serious implications, because this is being on a microscopic plane of fiction. That is, it would be equivalent to having ownership over a molecule, and the fact of having ownership over something so common, extensive and shared without any bureaucracy in between, breaks the flow of reality itself.

For this case, trying to apply a form of voice patent, any human being who records himself or tries to profit where his voice is involved is affected, since being repeatable, this can fit with such a patent and therefore, cause him justified damage. Plagiarism becomes inevitable here. It is a plane where instead of protecting, it only destroys. We have reached the limits of ownership.

Voice actors, in order to maintain control over their property, must claim that certain frequencies, phonetics, timbre and other matters completely tied to physics are theirs, and of course, this is not only ridiculous, it is also unfeasible in every sense.

Here is the singularity of fiction, a plane where having ownership is completely useless. The monopoly of violence is lost to the owners.

## POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS

This causes what would be the death of the system that the owners managed to maintain their flow of money and therefore, accumulation of wealth (capitalism), forcing them to implement post-capitalist models or flatly extinguish such system where it used to work. If they refuse such thing, they will **corrupt the principles, law and enhancing censorship, infringements of privacy and more** to protect interests from both sides (corporations and professional individuals).

It should be clarified that under the perspective of what is known as the left (specifically socialist and communist) to reach this singularity implies both hitting the bourgeois and the proletarians, since in the phenomenon of art, the proletariat is an owner and the proletarians themselves use property to subsist. Therefore, one cannot protect the proletariat and at the same time kill capitalism, both are affected by this singularity.

Instead, for an artist where his desire is to make art for the sake of making art, this offers him a freedom that did not exist before, making him not need physical or institutional dependencies to be able to materialize his art, making industries decentralized as there is no physical exclusivity to access such demands. This is possible because the technology has become so cheap and so efficient at the same time that this can be reproduced in most devices these mathematical replicas of reality that are then powered by AI. There is no longer dependence on the property of others to make art.

This is what the Singularity of Fiction is all about.
